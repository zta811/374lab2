# q1 ,using one page cover another page ,let the cover move donw and up . q2. i make a box just like you gave . but for q3, i tried to add check box before txt , but it never work.therefore ,i changed a way to realize add ,remove . i put all tasks  in a box ,and give them 3 mark ,x means delete .user can  select which they want , and put into their part . I might know how this works.Use a selector to select their parents, and use css to decorate the txt in div which is checked.But I don't think it affects functionality.I can put all of my input tasks in a div.Let the user choose what to do.If user  do not want to complete this task,i can set a similar button to place the selected task in the unclaimed.
